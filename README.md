What is bettr.friends? 

bettr.fiends is a social enterprise / tech start-up, created to help with the problem of problem betting and the affordability of betting generally. 

‘Social betting’ is a relatively new term and betting behaviour. Many believe it will grow quickly into the most popular form of betting for casual gamblers. Of course, when this new format grows, it will disrupt the status quo and established industry players. However, with the global focus on gambling reform and player protection, we see this to be a welcome change for many, especially by regulators, consumer protection groups and consumers themselves.

Problem gambling

Problem gambling is defined by a lack of affordability on behalf of the better. It is often the case that problem gamblers are from low-income households and their spending is a disproportionate amount of the household income. The average problem gambler is losing over £10,000 in the UK.

A recent report by the UK government found that there were 55,000 problem gamblers aged 11-16 in the UK and that levels of problem gambling were 300% worse when comparing young boys to their adult counterparts. This is despite gambling being illegal for this age group.

However, this is not just a problem for the UK. In Australia 41% of sports gamblers stated that their life had been negatively impacted by gambling and Australia as a nation has the highest average loss per person in the world at $1,288 per annum.

The opportunity

In 2019, gambling companies in the UK took £14.2bn* out of the pockets of consumers. Online sports betting constituted almost £1bn.
The UK online sports betting market is dominated by a small number of providers. The lack of options for sports bettors has allowed these providers to deliver ever increasing returns, as consumer debt continues to increase year on year. These factors, as well as growing social pressure, means that this industry is ready to be disrupted. 

The business model developed by bettr.friends will go a significant way to make betting more affordable, without diminishing enjoyment for large amounts of people. Up to 93% of the money that is currently spent on betting could stay in customers pockets. The user will be provided with access to the enjoyable aspects of sports betting with the added benefits of competing against friends and playing with the confidence of knowing that winnings are shared within a community, not with a bookmaker.
